## 🎯 Introduction
- The *AI-Driven Customer Insights Platform* is designed to help financial institutions better understand their customers through AI-powered analytics.
- *Problem Statement*: Traditional customer analysis methods are slow, inefficient, and lack personalization. Banks and financial institutions struggle to offer customized services due to limited insights from customer data.
- *Our Solution*: We leverage AI models to analyze transaction history, social media sentiment, and other data points to generate personalized banking insights and recommendations.

## 💡 Inspiration
- The idea originated from the *growing demand for personalized banking experiences*.
- Customers want tailored financial advice, but banks struggle to process large amounts of unstructured data efficiently.
- Inspired by AI advancements, we sought to build a system that transforms raw customer data into *actionable insights*.
- The goal is to enhance customer satisfaction while *optimizing bank revenue through better-targeted services*.

## ⚙️ What It Does
- *Customer Segmentation*: Groups customers based on spending patterns, demographics, and behavior.
- *Personalized Offers*: AI-generated banking offers tailored to individual customer needs.
- *Transaction Analysis*: Identifies spending trends and provides insights on financial habits.
- *Sentiment Analysis*: Uses social media data to understand customer sentiment toward financial products.
- *Real-time Insights*: Provides instant recommendations based on customer interactions.
- *Speech-recognition*: Enables users to send queries through real-time voice input. 

## 🛠️ How We Built It
- *Backend Development*:
  - Built using *Python* to handle API requests and process customer data.
  - Uses *Pandas and NumPy* for data cleaning and transformation.
  - *Caching with @lru_cache* to improve performance when loading customer data.
- *AI Model*:
  - *Ollama AI model* trained to analyze transaction history and customer preferences.
  - Pre-trained on financial datasets for accurate predictions.
- *Frontend*:
  - Uses *React* for an interactive UI.
  - Uses react speech recognition to enable users to send queries through real-time voice input. 

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
